<p>Alex Crisan is an up and coming full-stack web developer, former business owner, entrepreneur, audio engineer, and music producer. He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Business Administration and an Associate degree in Recording Arts, but his passion was always with technology. His love for technology lead him to develop his own business websites - where he began customizing WordPress templates and fell in love with coding. Over the past few years, Alex became interested in web development, taking courses on Team Treehouse, learning on Lynda, and self-teaching through books and tutorials. Eventually he discovered Flatiron School and their full-stack developer program. Alex began his journey in full-stack with a good foundation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and then began learning about Ruby, Rails, Rack, and many other languages and frameworks that all tie in together to form full-stack application development. His journey is one of hard-work and dedication. The Flatiron program would be one his most challenging endeavors, but also one of the most rewarding. </p>
